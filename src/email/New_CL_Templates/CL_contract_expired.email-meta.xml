    <subject>Your BlueWave Loan Contract has expired, but a new one is on the way!</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear (NAME),

Your BlueWave Solar Loan Contract has expired. This occured because your co-applicant/co-signer did not sign the contract within 2-3 days of you signing.

We will be sending you an email with your voided contract, as well as a new contract for both of you to sign. If you are no longer interested in proceeding with your application, please let us know.

If you have any questions, please reach out to our Customer Care Team at (844) 786-4100.

- Thanks from all of us here at BlueWave

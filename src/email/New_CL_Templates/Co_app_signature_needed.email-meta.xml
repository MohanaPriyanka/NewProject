    <textOnly>Hey (CUSTOMER NAME),

You&apos;re halfway there!

Thank you for signing your BlueWave Solar Loan Contract. Before your contract can be finalized, we need your co-applicant/co-signer to sign his/her contract as well.

Please note if your co-applicant/co-signer doesn&apos;t sign within 3 days of you signing, your contract will expire.

To prevent this from happening, please remind your co-applicant/co-signer to sign his/her contract.

If you have any questions, please reach out to our Customer Care Team at (844) 786-4100.

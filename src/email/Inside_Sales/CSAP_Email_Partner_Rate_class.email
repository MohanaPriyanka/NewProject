Hi (PARTNER NAME) Team,  


Thanks again for the community solar application! Our team examined the electric bill provided for {!Lead.FirstName} {!Lead.LastName}’s application. We discovered the rate class is not supported by New York’s community solar program. The state and the utility determine the eligibility criteria – unfortunately this one is out of our hands.  

Let us {!Lead.FirstName} has access to another utility account. If so, you can apply here or respond to this email with a question about whether that one might be eligible.  

Thanks, 

Signature

Hi {!Lead.FirstName},

I hope you're well and that your week's off to a good start.  I wanted to reach out with a heads up that, unfortunately, we no longer have community solar projects available in your area.  The existing projects' capacity has been filled meaning we cannot take any more Massachusetts residents at this moment in time.  We're actively working on developing and acquiring more projects and hope to offer our program again in the near future.

If you'd like to be notified once we have a community solar project available in your area, please reply to this email and we will place you on our wait-list.

It has been a pleasure getting to know you in past weeks and please stay in touch.  I'm your community solar resource so don't hesitate to reach out if you ever want to talk!

Sincerely,

Hi {!Lead.FirstName}, 

Thanks again for your community solar application! Our team examined the electric bill you provided and discovered your rate class is not supported by New York’s community solar program. The state and the utility determine the eligibility criteria – unfortunately this one is out of our hands. 

We know that’s disappointing, but perhaps there’s another way we can help. Do you have access to another utility account? If so, you can apply here or respond to this email with a question about whether that one might be eligible.

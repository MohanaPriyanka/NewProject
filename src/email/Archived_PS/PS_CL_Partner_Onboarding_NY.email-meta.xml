A list of all individuals whom you&apos;d like us to grant portal access to, including their full name, email, title, rep access (to view only their customers) or administrative access (to view all customers), and phone number (send via email).

2) A Copy of Your Company Logo (send via email)

3) Bank Info
In order for us to disburse your funds, you&apos;ll need an ACH account. To set one up,  please call 888-817-2703 and provide the following:

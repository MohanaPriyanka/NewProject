    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Welcome to BlueWave Community Solar! My name is {!User.Name} and I&apos;ll be your go-to resource for all things Partner Support related.

To start off, I&apos;ve created custom application links for you to send to potential Community Solar customers. These links allow us to track which customer application belongs to which sales rep.

Curious about next steps?
A member of our Community Solar Business Development team will be in touch to schedule an application demo and guide you through all things community solar. See attached for a guide to help get you started.

Still have questions? We&apos;ve got a team of people to help.

Partner Support - We are available 7 days a week from 8am-8pm EST at 888.817.2703 or partnersupport@bluewavesolar.com to answer any questions you have.

Customer Support - We have a separate Customer Care Team dedicated to answering all of your customers&apos; questions for the lifetime of their community solar share.

Thanks for partnering with us to revolutionize energy.
- All of us here at BlueWave

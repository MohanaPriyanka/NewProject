    <subject>How to access the BlueWave Community Solar Portal</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

My name is {!User.Name}, and I am a member of the BlueWave Partner Support Team. We&apos;re here to equip you with the tools you need to become a successful BlueWave Partner, starting with ensuring that you have a seamless on-boarding experience.

Before we can set up your BlueWave Community Solar application portal, you will need to review and sign the following documents which were included in the DocuSign package we recently sent over:

1. Sales Service Agreement (sign electronic copy)
2. Confidentiality Agreement (sign electronic copy)

We also require the following certificates if you haven&apos;t already provided them:

1. Certificate of Insurance (send a copy)

To get you up and running, please submit these materials as soon as possible.

Once we have reviewed your DocuSign package and certification, we can provide you with portal access.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us. We&apos;re happy to help.

Thanks for partnering with us to revolutionize energy.
- All of us here at BlueWave

Dear  {!Opportunity.Name},

BlueWave has disbursed {!Opportunity.Disbursal_3_Full_Install__c} via a two party check for your Solar Loan. The check was sent to the following address:

{!Opportunity.Concatenated_Billing_Address__c}

Please contact a member of our Customer Care if this is the incorrect address or you do not receive this check in the next 7 business days.

Please see the below details of the BlueWave SREC program:

SRECs are minted according to the following schedule:

Q1 generation (Jan 1 – March 31): July 15th
Q2 generation (April 1 – June 31): October 15th
Q3 generation (July 1 – September 30): January 15th
Q4 generation (October 1 – December 31): April 15th

BlueWave will pay you according to the following schedule:

Q1 generation: paid on or close to 9/1
Q2 generation: paid on or close to 12/1
Q3 generation: paid on or close to 3/1 (of following year)
Q4 generation: paid on or close to 6/1 (of following year)


SREC program update:

The State has made a change to the SREC program that becomes effective on January 8th, 2017. Home solar systems interconnected after that date will receive a reduced SREC factor of 0.8. The SREC factor determines the dollar value you receive per SREC created by your solar system’s energy production. Every 1 MWh of production will receive 80% of full SREC value. However, partial SRECs can not be minted. Therefore, any generation less than 1 MWh in a quarter will be rolled into your next quarter’s production total to be recognized at the subsequent SREC mint date. For more information about SRECs visit our FAQs.

Please remember that there is a built-in delay – which was established by the state of MA – between the time of generation and the time at which SRECs are minted and sold.


To be extra efficient, we&apos;d like to deposit your SREC earnings directly into your bank account! To make this happen, please provide your direct deposit information  here. Otherwise, we will mail your SREC earning as a paper check to the address we have on file.

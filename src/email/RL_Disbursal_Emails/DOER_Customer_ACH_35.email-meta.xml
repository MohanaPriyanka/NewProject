Dear {!Opportunity.Name},

BlueWave has disbursed {!Opportunity.Disbursal_1_Contract_Signature__c} to  {!Opportunity.Partner_tag2__c} for your Solar Loan.

In order to receive the additional 65% disbursement, they will need to report your system as interconnected and operating. There is nothing for you to do at this time, but if you have any questions, do not hesitate to call us at 844.786.4100.

Sincerely,

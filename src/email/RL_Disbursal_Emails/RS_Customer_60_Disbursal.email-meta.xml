Dear {!Opportunity.Name},

BlueWave has disbursed 60% of your Solar Loan to {!Opportunity.Partner_tag2__c}.

In order to receive the additional 10% disbursement, they will need to upload a confirmation of interconnection. There is nothing that you need to do at this time, but please feel free to contact us with any concerns or questions at 844.786.4100.

Sincerely,

Dear {!Opportunity.Partner_tag_lookup__c},

BlueWave has disbursed 60% of {!Opportunity.Name}&apos;s Solar Loan. Please contact a member of our Partner Support team if you do not receive these funds within 5 business days.

Please remember that in order to receive the additional 10% disbursement, you will need to upload a confirmation of interconnection. These documents can be uploaded by logging to your BlueWave Solar Loan Portal  where you will also be able to upload PTO documentation.

It is extremely important that you provide this information as soon as possible to ensure your customer is billed fairly. Please feel free to contact us with any concerns or questions.

Sincerely,
BlueWave Partner Support

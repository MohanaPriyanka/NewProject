Dear {!Opportunity.Name},

BlueWave has disbursed {!Opportunity.Disbursal_1_Contract_Signature__c} via a two party check for your Solar Loan. The check was sent to the following address:

{!Opportunity.Concatenated_Billing_Address__c}

Please contact a member of our Customer Care team if this is the incorrect address or you do not receive these funds within 7 business days.

In order to disburse the additional 65% of the loan, {!Opportunity.Partner_tag2__c} will need to report your system as interconnected and operating. There is nothing for you to do at this time, but if you have any questions, do not hesitate to call us at 844.786.4100.

Sincerely,
BlueWave Customer Care

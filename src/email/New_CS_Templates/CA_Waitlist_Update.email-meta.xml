    <textOnly>Hi (NAME),

Thanks for being patient.

We&apos;re working hard to bring you a Community Solar share.

In the meantime, here are some reminders about your share:

1. When will I see solar credits on my electricity bill?
Once your project is fully constructed, it typically takes about 3-4 months for your utility to begin processing solar credits on your utility bill.

After the utility is done processing your Community Solar share, your solar credits should appear on your utility bill every month.

2. How does Community Solar Share billing work?
Billing under your Community Solar On-Bill Credit Allocation Agreement will begin approximately one month after solar credits appear on your utility bill. Bills will be sent by email and standard mail. For more details on how billing works, click here.

- Thanks from all of us here at BlueWave

    <textOnly>Hey BlueWaver,

Welcome, we&apos;re happy you&apos;re here!

Right now, all of our Community Solar projects are fully subscribed, but as soon as a spot opens up, we&apos;ll be sure to let you know so that you can join your friends and neighbors in enjoying solar savings!

While you wait to be assigned to a farm, we&apos;ll check in periodically to keep you up to speed on all things Community Solar and BlueWave.

For right now we want to say thank you, and we&apos;re looking forward to a bright future ahead!

Thanks for joining the Wave.
- All of us here at BlueWave

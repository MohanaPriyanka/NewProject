    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.Partner_Name__c},

{!Lead.Name} has submitted their Community Solar application. Once we have reviewed and approved their application, we will complete the process by sending {!Lead.Name} the final documentation.

You can view where an opportunity stands in the quality control (QC) process by referencing the outstanding QC task report, which is sent biweekly by email.  This report will show any items which need your attention before an opportunity can be pushed through to completion.

Thanks for partnering with us to revolutionize energy

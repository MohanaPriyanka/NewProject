    <subject>Congratulations - your friend joined BlueWave Community Solar!</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi (NAME),

I&apos;d like to share the sun with you.

I signed up for BlueWave Community Solar to save on my electric bill and green my footprint, and I thought you might like to join too.

Besides your monthly savings, we each earn $100 if you use my referral code when you sign up!

Just go to bluewavesolar.com/sign-up/ and input my code “{!Contact.Referral_Code__c}” into the Referral Code box.

Do you live in MA and pay an electric bill? Great! Anyone with a utility bill in MA is eligible for BlueWave Community Solar.

Do you want to save on your monthly costs? 10% savings each month from Community Solar means more money for the other things you love!

Do you like fresh, local products? Community Solar means your electricity supports local jobs and clean energy.

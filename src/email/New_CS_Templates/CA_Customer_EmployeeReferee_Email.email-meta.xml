    <textOnly>Congrats on signing up for Community Solar through our BlueWave Friends and Family program. We’re glad to have you on board!

First things first, redeem your $250 bonus by emailing marketing@bluewavesolar.com.


Here&apos;s what to expect next on your solar journey:

1. We&apos;ll let you know when your solar farm &quot;goes online&quot;, meaning credits will begin flowing to your electric bill, reducing what you owe the utility each month.
 
2. You’ll start receiving bills from BlueWave for those solar credits, with a discount of 10% applied.
 
3. You can feel great about supporting solar development and your solar-powered savings.

Good things come to those who share in saving the planet.
- Thanks from all of us here at BlueWave

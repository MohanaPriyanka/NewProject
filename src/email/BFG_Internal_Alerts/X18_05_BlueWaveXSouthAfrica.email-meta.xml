Session II: BlueWaveXSouthAfrica
As you&apos;ve seen from the Outlook invite teaser, Professors Smithyman and Cowie (better known as Dean and Wayne) will be presenting an overview of the South African renewable landscape. Their presentation will cover the opportunities and challenges faced in each of the major segments of the market, particularly the barriers that exist at a political and policy level which are a microcosm of the countryâ€™s challenges as a whole.

After this session, you will be able to answer your friends&apos;/spouses&apos;/parents&apos; question on why BlueWave has an office in Cape Town, and much, much more!

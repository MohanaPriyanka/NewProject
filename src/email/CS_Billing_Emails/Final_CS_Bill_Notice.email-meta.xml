Hello {!Opportunity.Name},

This is a very important message about your Community Solar account with BlueWave.

Your Community Solar Share has been generating solar credits for you for the past eight months and you have been receiving those credits on your utility bill.

Since August, you have received three bills from BlueWave for these solar credits and all your statements remain outstanding.

We have tried our best to reach you over the past few months but regretfully have been unable to do so at this email address or the phone number and mailing address that you provided when you signed up for your Community Solar Share:

Phone: {!Opportunity.Customer_Phone__c}

Mailing Address: {!Opportunity.Concatenated_Billing_Address__c}

Please contact us at 844.786.4100 or customercare@bluewavesolar.com as soon as possible so that we can immediately address any questions you might have about your account and update your account details.
Thanks for joining us to make
‘Solar for the 100%&apos;

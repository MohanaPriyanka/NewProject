    <subject>Your solar farm is live</subject>
    <textOnly>Good news -

Your solar farm, %%Shared Solar System Name%%, is producing energy and sending it to your local energy grid!

What to expect next

You&apos;ll continue to receive your utility bill as usual, however you&apos;ll see a &quot;credit&quot; deduction to account for your new solar credits. Your utility will subtract your solar credits from your utility bill, and one to two months later, you&apos;ll receive a BlueWave bill for for those credits. And of course, we&apos;ll bill you at a discount every time.

It&apos;s important to know that you might receive different amounts of solar energy each month. This is because you receive a specific percent (aka share) of your solar farm&apos;s energy production. Since the number of hours of sunlight changes each month, the farm produces different amounts of energy.

    <subject>Nice to meet you</subject>
    <textOnly>Welcome to your clean energy future


Thanks for signing up for an Amp powered by BlueWave Community Solar share through &lt;partner name&gt;! Because of you, we&apos;re one step closer to achieving a cleaner energy future.

What to expect next

1. We match you with a local solar farm
We find a farm and assign you a share based on our energy needs. Think farm share, but for solar instead of veggies.

2. Your solar farm gets up and running
This could take a while depending on the construction status of your farm. We&apos;ll notify you when your farm is fully constructed and connected to the grid.

3. You start receiving savings
Once your solar farm is complete, your share generates energy and feeds it into the grid, resulting in a &quot;credit&quot; on your utility bill. You&apos;ll continue to receive your utility bill as usual, however the &quot;credit&quot; amount will lower what you owe your utility.

Thanks again for joining the clean energy movement, we&apos;re happy you&apos;re here. As part of our commitment to you, we&apos;d love to hear about your sign-up experience. Please take our 3-minute survey by clicking the link below:

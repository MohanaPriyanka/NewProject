Just a heads up that the estimated completion date of the solar farm you&apos;re subsribed to, &lt;solar farm name&gt;, has changed to &lt;season/year&gt;.

While it may take a little longer for your farm to be constructed, please know that your early support ensures the farm can be built. By signing up for a share, you&apos;re giving state regulators, utilities, and investors the message that there&apos;s a demand for more solar farms to be built.

When you sign up for a share, you&apos;re providing an immediate and meaningful impact. Thanks again for your patience.

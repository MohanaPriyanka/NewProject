    <textOnly>Dear %%Send Bills Contact: First Name%%,

Thank you for your recent community solar application - unfortunately we&apos;re unable to approve your application at this time for one of the following reasons:

2) You have less than 3 months of usage history
3) Your account is listed as demand rate and/or has over 25kw DC in demand

We&apos;re sorry we&apos;re unable to approve your application at this time, but we&apos;re happy to revisit your application once the above criteria has been met.

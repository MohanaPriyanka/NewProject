Thanks for signing up for a BlueWave Community Solar share{!CASE(Opportunity.Partner_Account__c,&apos;&apos;,&apos;&apos;,&apos;BlueWave Inside Sales&apos;,&apos;&apos;,&apos; with &apos;+ Opportunity.Partner_Account__c)}! Because of you, we&apos;re one step closer to achieving a cleaner energy future.

What to expect next

1. We match you with a local solar farm
We find a farm and assign you a share based on our energy needs. Think farm share, but for solar instead of veggies.

2. Your solar farm gets up and running
This could take a while depending on the construction status of your farm. {!IF(Opportunity.UCB__c,&quot;We&apos;ll notify you when your farm is fully constructed and connected to the grid.&quot;,&quot;In the next day or so you&apos;ll receive a link to your BlueWave portal, allowing you to see the status of your farm.&quot;)}

3. You start receiving savings
Once your solar farm is complete, your share generates energy and feeds it into the grid, resulting in a &quot;credit&quot; on your utility bill. You&apos;ll continue to receive your utility bill as usual, however the &quot;credit&quot; amount will lower what you owe your utility. {!IF(Opportunity.UCB__c,&apos;&apos;,&apos;A few months later, you will receive a bill from us for the credit amount at a &apos; + TEXT(Opportunity.Discount__c*100) + &apos;% discount, reducing your total energy cost.&apos;)}

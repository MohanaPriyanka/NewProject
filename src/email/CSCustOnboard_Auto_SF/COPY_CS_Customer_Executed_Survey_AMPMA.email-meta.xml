    <subject>Welcome to Amp Powered by BlueWave</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi there %%Send Bills Contact: First Name%%,

Welcome to Amp powered by BlueWave â€” our energy future starts with you!

Amp and BlueWave have partnered to bring you and hundreds of other customers community solar subscriptions that will save you money and advance the clean energy revolution. While Amp owns your community solar farm, BlueWave will help manage your subscription and answer any questions that may arise during your community solar journey.

Thanks for choosing us as your community solar provider and supporting local solar energy. Your community solar subscription is now fully executed.

We&apos;d like to learn more about your community solar subscription experience. Your feedback is very important to help us improve the shopping experience for other community solar customers. This survey will only take 3 minutes to complete.

Please see below for more information about how Amp powered by BlueWave Community Solar works and helps you save on your monthly utility bill.

How do my community solar savings work?
Your savings will come in the form of bill credits.

So, what&apos;s a bill credit?
The community solar farm you&apos;re subscribed to will produce energy which will feed into the electric grid for distribution to you utility. Your subscription entitles you to benefit from some of that energy production through deductions on your monthly electrical utility bill. Bill credits, or &apos;credits&apos;, represent the portion of energy your community solar subscription has produced.

What happens after credits appear on your utility bill?
BlueWave will then send you a monthly bill for the credits that were deducted from your monthly utility bill, at a 10% discount.

For example: if your farm generates $100 worth of credits, you will see a $100 deduction on your utility bill, and then receive a BlueWave bill for $90. That 10% savings, or in this case, $10, is the benefit you get from your subscription!

What will timing look like once credits start rolling?
Once your community solar farm begins generating electricity, your credits will start appearing on your electricity bill each month.

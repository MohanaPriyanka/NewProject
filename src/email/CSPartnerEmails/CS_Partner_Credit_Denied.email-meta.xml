    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.Partner_Name__c},

{!Lead.Name} has unfortunately not met BlueWave&apos;s required credit criteria and is therefore unable to proceed any further in the community solar application process.

We have notified {!Lead.Name} of his/her application status.

Please contact BlueWave Partner Support if you have any questions about this community solar application.

Thanks for partnering with us to revolutionize energy.

    <subject>{!Opportunity.Name} Has Signed Their Community Solar Subscription!</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Opportunity.BS_Sales_ID_c},

{!Opportunity.Name} has signed their community solar subscription agreement!

We still need to review their utility account information and size their subscription before their contract will be complete.

Once this has happened we&apos;ll notify you, at which point their contract will be fully executed.

Thanks for partnering with us to revolutionize energy.

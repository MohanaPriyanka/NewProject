We chatted previously about a solar installation for your home. We understand that solar ownership was not the right fit for you, but wanted to let you know we are now offering a new way to go solar-- without any additional cost.

HOW? Sign up for a Community Solar share through our partners at BlueWave Solar!

No Money Down - Only pay for solar credits you receive
No Installation Necessary - Hassle-free solar!
10% Monthly Energy Savings - Pay for your solar credits at a discount
No Cancellation Fees - Change your mind? No problem
Feel good! Your local farm creates local jobs and reduces air pollution

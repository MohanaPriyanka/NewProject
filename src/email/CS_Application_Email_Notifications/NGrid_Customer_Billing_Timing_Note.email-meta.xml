    <subject>Welcome to BlueWave!</subject>
    <textOnly>Your Community Solar Share agreement with BlueWave is fully executed!

Now that you&apos;re signed up, we&apos;d like to go over a couple important things about your Community Solar Share:

Here&apos;s how it will work

(What the timing will look like once credits start rolling)

Once your Community Solar Farm begins generating solar electricity, your solar credits will begin appearing on your electricity bill each month.

We’ll send you monthly progress updates as we go along so you know where things are at.

(How billing works once your solar credits start flowing)

Once your solar credits start showing up on your electricity bill from your utility you’ll see a bill from BlueWave for those credits (with a 10% discount applied).

We will bill you a month after the credits show up on your bill, usually on the 15th of every month.

You can view your account details and project updates on your portal.

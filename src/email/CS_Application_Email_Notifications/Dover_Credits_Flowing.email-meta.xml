    <subject>Your Community Solar Share on Dover Solar Farm is Live!</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

Dover Community Solar Farm is up and running, and solar credits will soon begin to flow to your Eversource account!

Keep your eyes peeled for credits on your coming utility bills

While you wait...take a look back at the site&apos;s construction with this time-lapse video.

Community Solar FAQs:

1. What do solar credits look like on my electricity bill?
Your solar credits will appear on the second page of your Eversource utility bill as &quot;Net Metering Credits&quot;.

2. When do I start paying for my solar credits?
After solar credits start showing up on your electricity bill from Eversource you’ll see your BlueWave Community Solar Share bill for those solar credits (with a 10% discount applied). You’ll receive your BlueWave Community Solar Share bill by email and in the mail at this time.

Since most of your energy use will be covered by your Community Solar Share production, your old electricity bill will decrease and your solar savings will start growing.

3. How do I pay my BlueWave Community Solar Share bill?
If you&apos;ve signed up for auto-pay, great! Read no further.

If not, you will be able to pay your monthly Community Solar Share bill by direct deposit or credit card through your online member portal.
You can also pay by check.

Community Solar Share billing works, visit our FAQs here.

Dear {!Contact.Name},

We’re checking in with an important update about your Community Solar Share.

You probably noticed that your recent bill from Eversource showed a large number of Solar Net Metering Credits applied to your account. This likely would have resulted in a zero balance on your bill and a large credit carrying forward on your account.

The good news? Your Community Solar farm is generating clean energy for you and your community!

What happened? Eversource applied the total value of Solar Credits your Share generated over a three month period to your account. These credits should have appeared as three separate line items on your December or January Eversource statement. When everything runs smoothly, your monthly Eversource bill should only show one month’s worth of Solar Credits, and your monthly BlueWave Solar bill will only charge for the solar energy generated during that period.

Before we send you a BlueWave Solar bill for the Solar Credits on your Eversource account, we’re working with Eversource to arrive at a solution that is most optimal for you. We’ll be in touch soon with that solution.

Thanks for Your Commitment to a Clean Energy Future.
We wanted to take this opportunity to say thank you for making this Community Solar project a reality. We know there have been some bumps in the road (like this one). We appreciate your patience as we work to deliver you a solar solution that&apos;s good for you, your community, and the planet.

In the meantime, if you have any questions, contact us at
customercare@bluewavesolar.com or (844) 786-4100.
We’re happy to help.

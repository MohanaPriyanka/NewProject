    <textOnly>My what a good friend you have.
Great news! Because your friend referred you to BlueWave, both of you have just scored $100 in referral bonus payments, on top of the 10% in solar savings you&apos;ll begin earning each month.

We will send you your $100 Visa Gift card to the billing address that we have on file for your account.

We&apos;re so happy to have you as a BlueWaver,
thanks for being part of the Community!

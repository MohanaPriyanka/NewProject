    <subject>Welcome to BlueWave!</subject>

Welcome to BlueWave!

Your Community Solar Share agreement with
BlueWave is fully executed!


Now that you’re signed up, we’d like to go over a couple important things about your Community Solar Share:

TIMING

(When you’ll start to see solar credits on your electricity bill)

Your Community Solar project is generating energy!
This means you’re going to see solar credits appear on your next National Grid bill.

After that, your solar credits will appear on your bill each month.

BILLING
(How billing works once your solar credits start flowing)

Once your solar credits start showing up on your electricity bill from National Grid you’ll see a bill from BlueWave for those credits
(with a 10% discount applied).

We will bill you a month after the credits show up on your bill, usually on the 17th of the month.

Your electricity bill will look something like this:
(The highlighted section is where your solar credits will appear)

Your BlueWave bill will look like this:

P.S. You’ll be able to view all your account details and project updates on your portal.

You can login to your portal at www.bluewavesolar.com and update your payment details at any time.


Thanks for joining us to make
&apos;Solar for the 100%&apos;
not just a mission, but a reality.

    <subject>We have good news about your Community Solar share!</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Opportunity.Name},  

We have good news about your BlueWave Community Solar Share! Your Community Solar System {!Opportunity.Shared_Solar_System_Name__c}, is up and running, and solar credits have begun to flow to your utility account.

Keep your eyes peeled for credits on your upcoming utility bills.

While you wait, here are some reminders of how this works.

BlueWave Community Solar Start Guide:What do solar credits look like on my electricity bill?
Your solar credits will appear on your utility bill as a negative line item as &quot;Net Metering Credits&quot; or &quot;Other Credits&quot;.

When do I start paying for my solar credits?
After solar credits start showing up on your electricity bill you&apos;ll see your BlueWave Community Solar bill for those credits (with a 10% discount applied). You will receive your BlueWave Community Solar bill by email and in the mail at this time.

Since most of your energy use will be covered by your Community Solar production, your old electricity bill will decrease and your solar savings will start growing.

How do I pay my BlueWave Community Solar Share bill?
If you&apos;ve signed up for auto-pay, great! Read no further.

If not, you will be able to pay your monthly Community Solar bill by direct deposit or credit card through your BlueWave Community Solar portal. You can also pay by check.

Thanks for joining the community! We&apos;re here to make sure you continue to enjoy savings from the sun.

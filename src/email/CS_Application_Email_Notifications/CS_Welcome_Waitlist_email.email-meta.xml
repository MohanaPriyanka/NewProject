Your Community Solar Share agreement with BlueWave is fully executed, locking in your place on the waitlist for one of our Community Solar farms!

All of the Community Solar farms in your local area are currently full, but once a spot opens up you’ll get notification that you’ve officially been assigned a Community Solar Share! Once you’ve been assigned your Community Solar Share, your agreement takes effect and becomes fully binding. Prior to this, you are free to cancel your agreement at any time with no fee.

Here are some quick details to keep in mind regarding how things will work with your future Community Solar Share. Don’t worry, we will send you a reminder with of all this information once you’ve officially been assigned your Share.


TIMING

(When you’ll start to see solar credits on your electricity bill)

Once the project is built, it takes some time to connect the project to the electricity grid so that you can start receiving your solar credits. When your utility provider has signed off on connecting the project, your Community Solar farm will begin to generate solar electricity!

If all goes well, we will start sending you solar credits in 6 months.

After that, your solar credits will appear on your utility bill every month. We’ll send you monthly progress updates on your Community Solar project as we go along so you know where things are at.

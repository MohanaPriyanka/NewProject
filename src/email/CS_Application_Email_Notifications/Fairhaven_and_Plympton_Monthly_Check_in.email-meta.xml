    <subject>July BlueWave Community Solar Bill Update</subject>
    <textOnly>*|MC:SUBJECT|*

Dear {!Property.Account.Name},

Please note that your July BlueWave bill was delayed while we sought confirmation from Eversource that solar net metering credits were in fact transferred to your utility account. We would never want to charge you for solar credits until we are 100% sure that you have benefitted from them! For this reason, we will be applying your July balance to your next BlueWave bill, which will be issued on the 15th of August.

Please be assured that no late fees have accrued on this batch of credits during this period. For accounts on Autopay, BlueWave will charge you in the next billing cycle for the total account balance due. The standard charge date for accounts on Autopay is the 20th of the month.

If you have any questions regarding your Community Solar share, please feel free to reach out to us at customercare@bluewavesolar.com or give us a call at 844.SUN.4100.


Thanks for choosing BlueWave as your
Community Solar provider and for
joining us to make &apos;Solar for the 100%&apos;
not just a mission, but a reality.

P.S. If you have any questions, please feel free

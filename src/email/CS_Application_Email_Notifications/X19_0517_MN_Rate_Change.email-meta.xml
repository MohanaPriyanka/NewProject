    <subject>Notice regarding your community solar share</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi NAME,

You&apos;re coming up on one year as a BlueWaver! As you enter your next contract year we wanted to update you on your savings rate and make sure you took a moment to check out your savings to date:

What have I saved so far?

Since joining BlueWave, you&apos;ve saved a total of XX!

Your savings are part of a community of others across Minnesota working together to support a cleaner energy future. Thank you for being here.

There are two upcoming annual rate changes that will affect your community solar subscription in the year ahead. One change is determined by Xcel program rules, the other is defined in your community solar contract.

Bill Credit Rate

What it is: The rate determined by the Public Utilities Commission (PUC) that you see on your monthly Xcel bill and is used to calculate your Solar*Rewards credits. The rate is updated annually and will be used to calculate your May solar credits.

Solar Electric Rate

What it is: The rate you pay for your community solar subscription. This rate is lower than the Bill Credit Rate used to calculate solar credit seen on your bill; the difference is your savings. This escalates annually per the terms of your contract.

What does this mean for me?

Effective May 1st your new Solar Electric Rate is [PLACEHOLDER MERGE].
These rate changes will not impact your subscription size, and credits will still flow to your account reducing what you owe to the utility each month.

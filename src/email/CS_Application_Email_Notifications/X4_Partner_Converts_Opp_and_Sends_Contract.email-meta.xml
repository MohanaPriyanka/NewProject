    <textOnly>Dear {!Opportunity.BS_Sales_ID__c},

Good news - {!Opportunity.Name}’s Community Solar application has been approved!

We have sent their customer sales agreement to them via DocuSign. These emails can occasionally end up in a Junk/Spam folder, so please notify your customer if they are having difficulty finding their contract.

Also, please note that each 32kWh contract block needs to be signed for separately.

Thanks for partnering with us to revolutionize energy

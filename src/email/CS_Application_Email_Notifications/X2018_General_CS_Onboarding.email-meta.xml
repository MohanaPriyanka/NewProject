    <subject>Welcome to BlueWave Community Solar!</subject>
    <textOnly>We have good news about your BlueWave Community Solar Share!

Your Community Solar Farm is up and running, and solar credits have begun to flow to your Utility account!

Now that you are receiving credits on your utility bill, you will also be receiving bills for these credits from BlueWave.

Please see details below as a reminder of how this works.

BlueWave Community Solar Start Guide:

1. What do solar credits look like on my electricity bill?
Your solar credits will appear on your utility bill as a negative line item called &quot;Net Metering Credits&quot; or &quot;Other Credits&quot;.

2. When do I start paying for my solar credits?
Now that solar credits have started showing up on your electricity bill, youâ€™ll see you have received your BlueWave Community Solar Share bill for those solar credits (with a 10% discount applied).

3. How do I pay my BlueWave Community Solar Share bill?
Please use your BlueWave Community Solar portal to pay your bill online or set up auto-pay for recurring payments to simplify your life! We can also accept payment over the phone or by check.

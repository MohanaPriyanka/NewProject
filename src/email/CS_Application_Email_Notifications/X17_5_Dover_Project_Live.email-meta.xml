Dear {!Contact.Name},

Your Community Solar project is fully constructed!

Check it out:

Now that your project is done, we want to run through a couple Community Solar FAQs:

1. When will I see solar credits on my electricity bill?
Now that your project is fully constructed, it typically takes about 3-4 months
for your utility to begin processing solar credits on your utility bill.

After the utility is done processing your Community Solar Share,
your solar credits should appear on your utility bill every month.

2. How does Community Solar Share billing work?
Billing under your Community Solar Net Metering Credit Allocation Agreement will begin
approximately one month after solar credits appear on your utility bill.
Bills will be sent by email and standard mail.
For more details on how billing works, click here.

Other Project Updates
We also want to let you know that your Community Solar farm will be owned and operated by BWC Buckmaster Pond, LLC, which was formed as a BlueWave subsidiary. BWC Buckmaster Pond, LLC has been purchased by a member of the AMP Solar group of companies, a global collection of renewable energy companies that specialize in building, owning, and operating solar projects. BlueWave and AMP are proud to be working together on this exciting Community Solar project. That said, all customer management activities (such as member portal, billing, and customer support) continue to be administered via the BlueWave Solar team.

If you have any questions about your
Community Solar Share, visit our FAQs here, give us a call at 844.786.4100 or email us at customercare@bluewavesolar.com

Thanks for joining us to make
&apos;Solar for the 100%&apos;

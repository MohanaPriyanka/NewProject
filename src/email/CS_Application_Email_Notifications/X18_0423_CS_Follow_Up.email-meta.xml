Hi {!Lead.FirstName},

Community Solar provides an easy, practical way for you to go solar without installing solar panels.

No Money Down - Sign up today and pay nothing until you start seeing solar savings show up on your utility bill each month.
10% Monthly Energy Savings - Pay for your solar credits at a discount each month. Plus, online automated bill pay takes the hassle out of your day!
No Installation Necessary - You enjoy the stable energy savings of solar without dealing with a physical rooftop installation or associated maintenance.
No Cancellation Fees - Change your mind? Now it&apos;s no problem to end your contract early, simply give us 90 days&apos; notice and we charge no cancellation fee.
Feel good! Your local farm creates local jobs and reduces air pollution

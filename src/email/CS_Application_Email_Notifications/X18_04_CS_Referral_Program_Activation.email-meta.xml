    <textOnly>It pays to share the sun. Literally.
Have you been enjoying saving 10% each month with BlueWave? Pass it on.

From today through May 1st, 2018, for every friend you successfully refer* to BlueWave Community Solar, you will get a $100 Visa Gift Card from BlueWave and your friend will get a $100 Visa Gift Card.

*Successful means your friend signs up &amp; is approved for a share of a BlueWave Community Solar farm.

How to Share:

Log in to your BlueWave Community Solar Portal.
Click &quot;send referral&quot; link located in the upper left hand corner of your customer portal, you&apos;ll just need your friend&apos;s email address.

Shortcut: You can also simply tell your friend to go to bluewavesolar.com/sign-up/ and use your referral code {!Contact.Referral_Code__c}.

Call your friend to let them know they should be excited!
Your friend signs up &amp; joins a BlueWave Community Solar farm.
Both of you receive $100 from BlueWave and go celebrate together!

Not sure who to refer? Use this checklist as your guide:

Do you know anyone in MA who pays a utility bill? Great! Anyone with a utility bill in MA is eligible for BlueWave Community Solar.

Do you know anyone who wishes they spent less every month? 10% savings each month means more money can be spent on groceries, savings for the future, or other things you love!

Do you know anyone who likes fresh, local products? Community Solar means local jobs, local clean energy, and no local emissions.

Good things come to those who share in saving the planet.
Thanks for being part of the Community!

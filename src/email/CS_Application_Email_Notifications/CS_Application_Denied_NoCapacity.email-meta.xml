    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.Name},

Thank you for your recent application to participate in our Community Solar program. At this time, we are unable to approve your application because we do not have available Community Solar Capacity in your electric service area.

Your account has been put on a waitlist for the time being. We will be in touch when we have a project in your area ready for your participation.

Thank you again for your interest in Community Solar.
Have a question? Call 1-877-404-4129.

Sincerely,

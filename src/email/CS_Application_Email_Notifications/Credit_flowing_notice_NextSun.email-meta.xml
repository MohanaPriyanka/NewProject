Dear {!Contact.Name},

The Shirley Community Solar Farm is now operating and credits are flowing to your National Grid account!


Credits? National Grid Bill? BlueWave Bill?

Your solar Net-Metering Credits have begun to appear on your National Grid bill! You should have seen them on this month&apos;s bill. If you haven&apos;t seen them, give us a call.
Now that your solar credits are flowing to your National Grid account,
you will receive your first BlueWave bill this month.
Bills will be sent via email and standard mail.
For more information on how billing works, please click here.

If you have any questions about your
Community Solar Share, visit our FAQs here, give us a call at 844.786.4100 or email us at customercare@bluewavesolar.com

Thanks for joining us to make
&apos;Solar for the 100%&apos;
not just a mission, but a reality.</textOnly>

    <subject>Reminder: Enroll for Direct Deposit &amp; Provide System Data to Receive SREC Payments</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear *|MMERGE3|*,

Great news! Your Solar Renewable Energy Credit (SREC) payment is just around the corner.

Reminder!  Because you have signed up for BlueWave&apos;s fixed monthly payment option for SRECs you must enroll in direct deposit in order to receive payment

Setting Up Direct Deposit:

Provide your deposit information here so we can have all of your SREC earnings deposited directly into your bank account.
This is a program requirement for the SREC payment plan you have selected.

We&apos;ll be in touch again to let you know about your incoming SREC payment.

If you have any questions about SREC payments or your Home Solar Loan, contact us at customercare@bluewavesolar.com or (844) 786-4100.

Weâ€™re happy to help.

    <textOnly>Dear {!Opportunity.Name},

Great news! We have received your system information from your solar installer and have successfully submitted your SREC registration to the Production Tracking System. This means you will soon get paid for the SRECs that you earn through solar energy generation.

If you want to receive your payments ASAP, enroll in direct deposit ASAP!

Setting Up Direct Deposit:
Provide your deposit information here so we can have all of your SREC earnings deposited directly into your bank account.

For your reference, please review the following schedules of SREC minting and BlueWave payments to your account.

SRECs are minted from the previous quarter, as shown here:
Q1 generation (Jan 1 – March 31): July 15th
Q2 generation (April 1 – June 31): October 15th
Q3 generation (July 1 – September 30): January 15th
Q4 generation (October 1 – December 31): April 15th

You can expect SREC payments, when earned, on the following dates:
Q1 generation: paid on or close to 9/1
Q2 generation: paid on or close to 12/1
Q3 generation: paid on or close to 3/1 (of following year)
Q4 generation: paid on or close to 6/1 (of following year)

Here&apos;s an example of how that works:
An interconnection date of 8/23/2017 would set your first quarter of SREC production to be Q3 2017. Based on the payment and mint schedule, if you produced enough electricity to mint at least one SREC within Q3 (July 1-Sept 30), that SREC would mint on Jan 15 of 2018 and be paid to you at the beginning of March 2018.

SREC Payment Calculations:
Home solar systems will receive an SREC factor of 0.8, so for every 1.25MW of energy produced, you will mint 1 SREC. The SREC factor determines the dollar value you receive per SREC created by your solar system’s energy production. Please be aware that BlueWave can only sell full SRECs, so any partially minted SRECs and unminted production will be rolled over to next quarter.
Please remember that there is a built-in delay – which was established by the state of MA – between the time of generation and the time at which SRECs are minted and sold.
For more information about SRECs visit our FAQs.

We&apos;ll be in touch after the next mint date (refer to schedule above!) to let you know if you should expect an SREC payment for your electric generation.


If you have any questions about SREC payments or your Home Solar Loan, contact us at customercare@bluewavesolar.com or (844) 786-4100.

We’re happy to help.

    <subject>Congratulations! SREC Payments are Headed Your Way!</subject>
    <textOnly>Congratulations *|MMERGE3|*!

Based on your solar generation this quarter you minted &lt;&lt;MERGE&gt;&gt; SRECs that are in the process of being sold.

Based on the BlueWave SREC payment schedule, you will receive this payment &lt;&lt;MERGE&gt;&gt;.

Along with your payment, on your next statement  we will send you detailed information of all SREC sale prices and costs.

Reminder: SREC minting and BlueWave Payments Schedule

SRECs are minted according to the following schedule:
Q1 generation (Jan 1 – March 31): July 15th
Q2 generation (April 1 – June 31): October 15th
Q3 generation (July 1 – September 30): January 15th
Q4 generation (October 1 – December 31): April 15th

BlueWave will pay you according to the following schedule:
Q1 generation: paid on or close to 9/1
Q2 generation: paid on or close to 12/1
Q3 generation: paid on or close to 3/1 (of following year)
Q4 generation: paid on or close to 6/1 (of following year)

Here&apos;s an example of how that works:
An interconnection date of 8/23/2017 would set your first quarter of SREC production to be Q3 2017. Based on the payment and mint schedule, if you produced enough electricity to mint at least one SREC within Q3 (July 1-Sept 30), that SREC would mint on Jan 15 of 2018 and be paid to you at the beginning of March 2018.

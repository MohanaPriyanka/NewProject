    <subject>Reminder: Enroll for Direct Deposit to Expedite SREC Payments</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear *|MMERGE3|*,

Great news! Your {{MERGE QUARTER}} Solar Renewable Energy Credit (SREC) payment is just around the corner.

Want your money ASAP? Register for direct deposit today to receive payment up to a week earlier than waiting for a paper check.

Setting Up Direct Deposit:
Provide your deposit information here so we can have all of your SREC earnings deposited directly into your bank account.

Filling out this form is optional. If you choose not to provide this information we will still mail you paper checks for your solar earnings.

If you have any questions about your Home Solar Loan,
contact us at customercare@bluewavesolar.com or (844) 786-4100.
Weâ€™re happy to help.

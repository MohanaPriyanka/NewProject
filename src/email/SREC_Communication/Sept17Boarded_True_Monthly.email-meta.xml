    <textOnly>Dear {!Opportunity.Name},

Great news! We have received your system information from your solar installer and have successfully submitted your SREC registration to the Production Tracking System. This means you will soon get paid for the SRECs that you earn through solar energy generation.

Reminder!  Because you have signed up for BlueWave&apos;s fixed monthly payment option for SRECs you must enroll in direct deposit in order to receive payment

Setting Up Direct Deposit:

Provide your deposit information online or over the phone so that we can have all of your SREC earnings deposited directly into your bank account.

This is a program requirement for the SREC payment plan you have selected.

We&apos;ll be in touch again to let you know about your incoming SREC payment.

If you have any questions about SREC payments or your Home Solar Loan, contact us at customercare@bluewavesolar.com or (844) 786-4100.

Weâ€™re happy to help.

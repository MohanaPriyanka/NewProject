    <subject>SREC Generation Update from BlueWave</subject>
    <textOnly>Hey there *|MMERGE3|*,

Based on your solar generation this quarter you did not generate enough electricity to mint an SREC payment. There are two reasons this may have occurred:

This was just your first quarter of SREC eligibility and you were interconnected mid-way through the quarter, not giving your system enough time online to produce enough electricity needed to mint your first full SREC.
Your system simply didn’t produce enough during this quarter to mint a full SREC. If you have concerns about your system not producing at its fullest capacity, please contact your installer to have them take a look to make sure your system is working as it should. If you are having trouble getting in touch with your installer, please contact BlueWave Customer Care and we will step in to assist.

Either way, fear not, any production that goes unminted is carried over to the next mint date, so you won&apos;t lose out on any kWhs generated so far.

If you already know the SREC minting/payment schedule and have already signed up for direct deposit, you can stop reading here, if not...read on!

Reminder: SREC minting and BlueWave Payments Schedule

SRECs are minted according to the following schedule:
Q1 generation (Jan 1 – March 31): July 15th
Q2 generation (April 1 – June 31): October 15th
Q3 generation (July 1 – September 30): January 15th
Q4 generation (October 1 – December 31): April 15th

BlueWave will pay you according to the following schedule:
Q1 generation: paid on or close to 9/1
Q2 generation: paid on or close to 12/1
Q3 generation: paid on or close to 3/1 (of following year)
Q4 generation: paid on or close to 6/1 (of following year)

Here&apos;s an example of how that works:
An interconnection date of 8/23/2017 would set your first quarter of SREC production to be Q3 2017. Based on the payment and mint schedule, if you produced enough electricity to mint at least one SREC within Q3 (July 1-Sept 30), that SREC would mint on Jan 15 of 2018 and be paid to you at the beginning of March 2018.

    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName},

Thank you for your recent application to participate in BlueWave&apos;s Community Solar program. Regretfully, we are unable to approve your application at this time. The denial of your application was based upon information contained in a consumer credit report obtained from TransUnion. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that we inform you that your credit score, taken on {!Lead.Date_of_Credit_Report__c} , is {!Lead.LASER_Credit_Score__c} on a range of 501-990.

Major factors adversely affecting your credit score are the following:

{!Lead.Credit_Report_Detail_1__c}
{!Lead.Credit_Report_Detail_2__c}
{!Lead.Credit_Report_Detail_3__c}
{!Lead.Credit_Report_Detail_4__c}

Please note that you have certain rights with respect to your credit report. If you request a copy of the information in your credit file from TransUnion within 60 days of receiving this denial, you are entitled to a free copy of your report. You have the right to directly dispute with the consumer reporting agency the accuracy and completeness of any information furnished by that agency.

We welcome a new credit application from you in the future if and when your credit profile has improved.

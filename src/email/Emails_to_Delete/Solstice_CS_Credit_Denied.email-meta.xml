    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName},

Thank you for your recent application to participate in Community Solar. Regretfully, we are unable to approve your application at this time. The denial of your application was based upon information contained in a consumer credit report obtained from TransUnion. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that we inform you that your credit score, taken on {!Lead.Date_of_Credit_Report__c} , is {!Lead.LASER_Credit_Score__c} on a range of 501-990.

Major factors adversely affecting your credit score are the following:

{!Lead.Credit_Report_Detail_1__c}
{!Lead.Credit_Report_Detail_2__c}
{!Lead.Credit_Report_Detail_3__c}
{!Lead.Credit_Report_Detail_4__c}

Please note that you have certain rights with respect to your credit report. If you request a copy of the information in your credit file from TransUnion within 60 days of receiving this denial, you are entitled to a free copy of your report. You have the right to directly dispute with the consumer reporting agency the accuracy and completeness of any information furnished by that agency.

We welcome a new credit application from you in the future if and when your credit profile has improved.

Credit information was taken from TransUnion, which can be contacted at (877)-322-8228.TransUnion is located at 555 West Adams St., Chicago IL.

If you have any questions, you can reach us at info@bluewave-capital.com or you can call 617-418-4001

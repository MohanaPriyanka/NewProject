    <subject>Do You Know How The SMART Program is Going to Affect You?</subject>
    <textOnly>SMART could impact your current customers.

Start preparing with BlueWave today!

What&apos;s the latest?
The SMART program is expected to start in June - customers you&apos;re talking to now could end up in SMART if their system is interconnected after SMART begins.

Under SMART, SRECs will no longer be available for new projects. Solar will instead receive an all-in value per kWh, as laid out in the Base Compensation Rates for SMART program, which was released by the MA Department of Energy Resources (DOER) in January.

Why prepare now?
As mentioned above, customers starting the process now and over the next couple months will be increasingly likely to be in SMART rather than SREC 2. Customers will likely have questions now!

How should my team prepare?

The specifics of calculating the value customers will receive in SMART are new and different than SREC 2, and can be complex.
BlueWave is here for you to answer any questions you may have, to provide reference tools, and to help you determine how to be most effective with future program changes.
We can help you and your team understand SMART and calculate the value available to the residents you&apos;re working with, and how to communicate that clearly.
Please follow up with us to set up time for us to work with you.

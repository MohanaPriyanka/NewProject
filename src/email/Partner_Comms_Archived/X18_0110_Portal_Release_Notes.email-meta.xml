    <textOnly>Greetings from BlueWave,

Your technology platform fee dollars are hard at work!

We&apos;re continuously listening to your feedback and working to improve our loan portal.

Here are our latest release notes on updates that went live yesterday (1/10/18) to simplify the loan process for you and your customers.

What&apos;s Changed:

All applications will be emailed to customers rather than allowing you to complete the application on behalf of the customer.

Want to apply together with your customer? No problem! Customers may use your computer to log in to their email and fill out the application.
Remember, you&apos;ll have to log out of the portal first!

Applicants that have been sent an application will now show up in the portal, even before they have submitted their information.
Expired and canceled applicants will now appear on a separate tab within the portal rather than appear with live applications
We added a &quot;declined&quot; tab showing applications that failed credit checks to keep track of these applicants.
Customer applications are now processed as one step instead of two.

Customers are asked for prequalification information (social security number, annual income), are instantly prequalified, then are asked for income documentation (for final approval) in one single step.
This means one less step for you as you&apos;ll no longer need to send the customer the final approval/income documentation step.


Thanks for working with BlueWave to provide Solar for Everyone, Everywhere.

Dear {INSERT NAME},

We've updated our product exhibits in our partner agreement documents to appropriately reflect the product terms that are available to homeowners in the BlueWave portal. The previous documents you had acknowledged were outdated and we appreciate your patience as we tidy up your documents. 

Please review the updated Exhibits A and C for your BlueWave Partner Agreement attached and acknowledge them by indicating with a simple reply email back to us that you have received these.

Please let us know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

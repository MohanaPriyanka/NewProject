    <textOnly>ALERT: DPU Issues Order on Eversource Rate Case and DOER Releases Incentive Rates for SMART Program

Dear {!Contact.Name},

As our partner we want to make sure you are up-to-date on the latest issues that are most important to the solar industry. Last week the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (DPU) issued its order regarding Eversource&apos;s 2017 rate case. As part of the order, Eversource received approval for the implementation of a monthly minimum reliability charge (MMRC). The MMRC consists of a customer charge and a mandatory demand charge and will be imposed on all new residential net metering customers whose system is placed in service on or after December 31, 2018. Unfortunately, Massachusetts is first in the nation to place a mandatory demand charge on residential customers.

We will be coordinating a response through our own network as well as through industry associations. We&apos;re working with several solar groups to understand the details and determine how to respond effectively. If you are interested in being involved, please reply to this message and we will be in touch shortly with opportunities for action.

We also want you to know that Vote Solar announced that they are appealing the DPU&apos;s order to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. Their announcement can be found here.

Stay tuned, but in the meantime - here are some FAQ&apos;s about the MMRC and DPU ruling that will hopefully help you understand how this might impact our customers and businesses.

How is the minimum bill structure set up?

It has two components: 1) A fixed monthly charge and 2) A demand charge that is based on the customer&apos;s peak power usage for the month, in kW
In parallel, the distribution rate per kWh for these customers is reduced by over 40%

Who will it impact?

It will impact rooftop solar customers whose systems go active on or after Dec 31, 2018
This will be a reason for customers to get their system&apos;s online before the end of December this year, when they would be hit with these new charges and different bill structure.

What are the implications for residential solar in Eversource territory?

While it is still early, the minimum bill structure could reduce the amount of a customer&apos;s bill that can be offset by solar by 10-15%. Depending on their peak usage, the new structure could increase a solar customer&apos;s bill by several hundred dollars a year
Overall, this effectively creates a new rate class for net metering customers, charging ONLY net metering customers fixed fees and demand charges that will substantially increase their bills

We are working on your behalf towards a solution to this and hope you join us for a robust and effective response.

DOER Releases Incentive Rates for SMART Program

Additionally on Thursday, January 11, 2018 the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources (DOER) released the results of the SMART competitive procurement setting the base incentive rates for the new solar incentive program which is anticipated to begin in May or June of 2018.

Based on the procurement results, the initial residential rates (systems less than 25kW AC), for the SMART program (which are for ten years) are as follows:

National Grid:                      $0.31126
Eversource (NStar):             $0.34
WMECO:                                $0.28576
Nantucket:                            $0.034
Unitil:                                     $0.31126

Thank you again for your partnership and please contact us with an questions you may have.

Sincerely,

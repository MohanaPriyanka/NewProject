    <textOnly>Dear {!User.FirstName},

As you may have heard, parts of the United States will be experiencing a total solar eclipse on August 21st, 2017.

This means that the moon will briefly block the light of the sun from reaching the Earth. A total solar eclipse can only be seen from a small area on Earth by those in the center of the moon&apos;s shadow as it passes.

To make sure you are prepared, we wanted to share a few tips and fun facts about the coming eclipse.

Here&apos;s what you can expect during the total solar eclipse:

A complete lack of light for approximately 2 minutes and 36 seconds

Check sites like this one for exact times in the towns of your installations

Potential drops in temperature of up to 10 degrees Fahrenheit
Shadows may look sharper than usual on the ground
Stars, and even the planet Mercury, may be visible during the minutes of the total eclipse!

Reminder! Do NOT attempt to look at the sun during the partial eclipse without proper eye protection.

Fun facts we wanted to share with you, feel free to pass along to your customers!

This is the nation&apos;s first total solar eclipse since 1979 and the first to cross from the West Coast to the East Coast since 1918
The next major solar eclipse over the US will be in 2023 but this eclipse could be once in a lifetime for some states!
Eclipses provide a great opportunity for scientists to study the sun&apos;s corona, the halo of rays around the sun
The sun is about 400x bigger than the moon, but the moon can block its light since it is about 400x closer to the Earth!
The moon has an inner shadow called the umbra which causes the total eclipse, the moon&apos;s outer shadow called the penumbra will cause a partial solar eclipse

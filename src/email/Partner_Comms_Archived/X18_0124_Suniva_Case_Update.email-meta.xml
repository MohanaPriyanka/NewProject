    <textOnly>Suniva Trade Case Update

Dear {!Contact.Name},  

As a valued BlueWave partner, we want to keep you up-to-date regarding issues related to the solar industry.  Yesterday the Suniva Trade Case decision was announced, imposing a declining tariff on imported solar PV cells over the next four years starting February 7th, 2018. Please see details below:

Year 1          Year 2         Year 3         Year 4
Safeguard Tariff on Modules and Cells 30%              25%            20%            15%
Cells Exempted from Tariff  2.5 GW        2.5 GW        2.5 GW       2.5 GW

We recognize the impact of this decision, and the implications it will have on the solar industry. Please see our official statement here.

While we are disappointed by this outcome, we intend to push forward with our industry partners and coordinate a response. If you would like to get involved, please contact Mark Sylvia.

Our commitment to the solar industry prevails and so does our vision of making solar available for everyone, everywhere.

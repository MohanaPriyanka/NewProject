    <subject>Announcing Better Loan Terms for Your Customers</subject>
    <textOnly>As of December 21, our loan terms in South Carolina and North Carolina are changing.

What&apos;s changed:

Extended Interest-Only Period
- 18 months -

Why:

We are changing our loan interest-only period from 12 to 18 months to ensure your customers are able to take full advantage of the solar tax incentives available to them in your region. Please note that any customer who has selected a loan product prior to the transition date will still be eligible for that product.

Important announcement:
Due to the Equifax data breach, many of your customers have frozen their credit. In order for us to process an application as quickly as possible we need to make sure the applicant unfreezes their credit before we run a credit check. This is a friendly reminder to please make sure all loan applicants unfreeze their credit before we begin processing an application. Click below to unfreeze your credit.

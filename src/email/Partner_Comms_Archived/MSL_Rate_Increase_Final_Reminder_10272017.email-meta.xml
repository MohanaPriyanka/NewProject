    <subject>Final Reminder: MSL Rate Increase at Midnight Tonight</subject>
    <textOnly>MSL Rate Change Final Reminder

Hello,

As a valued BlueWave Partner, we wanted to remind you of the midnight deadline tonight for customers to take advantage of the 3.99% rate with the Mass Solar Loan.

By midnight tonight, Friday, October 27, 2017, your customer must be pre-qualified and have selected a loan product to continue their application through the BlueWave portal in order to be eligible for the 3.99% rate. A customer can be granted the rate without technical confirmation.

If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact Partner Support at partnersupport@bluewavesolar.com or (888) 817-2703.

Due to high volume, the Partner Support line may be busy, please be assured that our team answers all voicemails promptly.

In an effort to expedite any pre-qualified customers, below is a series of screenshots that guide you through the portal steps for a pre-qualified customer.

Once your screen updates to show the second portion of the application has been sent out, your customer is officially granted the 3.99% MSL rate.

Step 1: Ensure you continue the application for customers designated as &quot;pre-qualified&quot;.

Step 2: Select the appropriate loan product for your pre-qualified customer applicant.

Thank you for your support in working with customers through the application process.

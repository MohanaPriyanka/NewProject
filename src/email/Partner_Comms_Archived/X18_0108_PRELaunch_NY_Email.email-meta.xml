Who We Are
BlueWave Solar (“BlueWave”) is a renewable energy company founded on a mission to make solar available for everyone, everywhere. BlueWave partners with solar contractors like you to help achieve this mission!

Residential Solar Loan
Our proprietary loan platform will be our first product we launch in New York. Our platform makes financing solar a smooth process for customers and you, the installer. Working with BlueWave means seamless online approvals, best in class disbursals, and sales rep incentives based on sales volume!

We simplify the loan process without hiding anything from our partners or customers.

ASK US ABOUT COMMUNITY SOLAR
As a solar contractor ourselves, we have developed over 100 MW of community solar and manage these community solar customers through our powerful platform. Let&apos;s talk!

New York, we&apos;re almost ready to launch!
In the next few days, we will share more information on our launch timing as well as what makes BlueWave a terrific partner for you.

Interested?
Please contact our New York Business Development Manager, George Wissing (917) 439-8982.

We hope to partner with you to provide Solar for Everyone, Everywhere.

    <textOnly>The launch of the SMART program in MA will impact the residential solar market. Please see the following updates on anticipated timing.

Let&apos;s prepare together.

Remind me, what is &quot;SMART&quot;?
The MA Dept. of Energy Resources (DOER) is in the process of implementing SMART (Solar Massachusetts Renewable Target), a new compensation program with the goal of promoting cost-effective solar development in Massachusetts. SMART will replace the existing SREC program in MA.

What may change?

Under SMART, SRECs will no longer be available for new projects. Solar will instead receive an all-in value per kWh.
Residential solar compensation is likely to face a reduction in value of 10% or more.
SMART compensation for residential solar spans 10 years, rather than the 20 years for larger capacity projects.
Energy storage is covered as a value &quot;adder&quot; for residential solar, but with complex qualifications. Connect with us for more details if your team offers, or is considering offering, solar storage in 2018.

When will this impact offerings for customers?

Results on base compensation rates are expected by mid-January – this will provide more detail on how SMART compares to the current SREC program.
The start date of the SMART program depends on when the Dept. of Public Utilities (DPU) reaches a final decision about certain aspects of the program.
The latest policy updates indicate that that SMART may begin in June or July 2018.

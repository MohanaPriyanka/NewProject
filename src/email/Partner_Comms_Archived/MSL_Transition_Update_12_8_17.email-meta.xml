MSL Transition Reminder

Hello,

As a valued BlueWave Partner, we wanted to remind you of the upcoming change in terms of the Mass Solar Loan (MSL). As of December 13th, 2017, the modified MSL offering will only provide an interest-rate buy down for low income-qualified customers*.

This means starting December 13th, 2017 all customers with income levels at 80% or higher of the State Median Income will have an effective interest rate of 6.49% with MSL.

BlueWave must receive complete, accurate customer application materials by For non-low income-qualified customers to qualify for the current 4.99% interest rate with MSL, 5pm this Friday, December 8th, 2017. Complete application materials must include customer income documentation and technical confirmation.

The lead time between 12/8/17 and the MA CEC deadline of 12/12/17 allows for the necessary time for underwriting. To receive the existing benefits under the current MSL program, customer signature(s) must be timestamped on the loan documents by 12/12 11:49 pm EST,  if there is a co-signer/co-applicant, both signatures must be timestamped by this time and date.

While BlueWave will process all applications received after December 8th, 2017 as quickly as possible, these applications are unlikely to have underwriting complete prior to the MA CEC cut-off on 12/12/17.

After 12/13/2017 BlueWave will continue offering the Mass Solar Loan program for low and moderate income-qualified customers.

For all other customers, BlueWave will offer non-MSL loans with terms benefitting customers:

Lower interest rates of 5.99% rather than the MSL 6.49% rate for a 10-year loan
Loans up to $100,000 rather than the $60,000 MSL limit
Interest-only period of 18 months

If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact Partner Support at partnersupport@bluewavesolar.com or (888) 817-2703.

Due to high volume, the Partner Support line may be busy, but please be assured that our team answers all voicemails promptly.

Thank you for your support in working with customers through the application process.

    <subject>Sign Up for ACH And Get Your Community Solar Commission Faster!</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

To sign up for ACH commission payments, please call Partner Support at 888.817.2703.

How it Works
Signing up to receive your Community Solar commission payments via ACH means you&apos;ll receive your money faster!

Instead of a check payment taking weeks to be processed and deposited, ACH payments will be directly deposited into your account within 1-2 business days.

Your ACH commission payment will be processed on the 15th of every month, and will include all the Community Solar deals you closed during the previous month.

For example, on June 15th all the Community Solar deals you closed in May would be processed, and you would receive your ACH payment 1-2 business days later.

What We Will Need From You
When you call Partner Support 888.817.2703 to set up ACH, we will need your bank account and routing number to complete the set up for payment.

Thank you for partnering with BlueWave
to revolutionize energy.

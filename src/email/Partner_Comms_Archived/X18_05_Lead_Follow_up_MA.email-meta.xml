Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

Based on BlueWave&apos;s tracking of all customer applications, we currently have a list of {!Account.Name} leads who never completed their applications for financing with BlueWave.

Please email partnersupport@bluewavesolar.com if you would like us to provide you with the names and email addresses of your leads who did not complete their loan application!

How to Re-Engage:
BlueWave has launched new ways to go solar since you last worked with these potential customers. Please feel free to use some of the language below to reach out to your leads. 

1) The FlexRate Loan: We now offer a new loan structure with a lower interest rate for years 1-5 to reduce total cost of ownership during this time. After year 5, you are protected by a “double-capped” rate with limits in place for both annual and total possible loan rate. FlexRate features include:

No Money Down – Pay nothing until after your installation is finished.
12 or 18-month interest only period – Ease into payments by paying interest only for the beginning of your loan term.

2) Community Solar: If you have decided that a rooftop installation does not make sense for your needs, you can still save &amp; reduce your emissions by signing up for a Community Solar share as an easy, practical solution for home energy-- bringing you reliable savings without a long-term commitment.

No Money Down - Sign up today and pay nothing until solar savings start showing up on your utility bill each month.
10% Monthly Energy Savings - Pay for your solar credits at a discount each month. Plus, online automated bill pay takes the hassle out of your day!

Thanks for partnering with us to revolutionize energy,
- All of us here at BlueWave

    <subject>Sign your solar loan contract by midnight tonight</subject>

Dear &lt;Customer Name&gt;,

This is a friendly reminder to please sign your BlueWave Solar Loan docs before the Mass Solar Program changes on December 13th.

IMPORTANT DETAILS:
Your Solar Loan contract with BlueWave is currently outstanding. Because you applied for your loan under the Mass Solar Loan Program, we wanted to make you aware of an upcoming deadline set by the program. The loan terms available under this program will be changing on December 13th, 2017 (next Tuesday).

In order for you to receive the benefits available under the current program structure, please sign your loan documents and return them to BlueWave by December 12th at midnight.

Please note, if there is a co-signer or co-applicant, BOTH signatures must be timestamped by December 12th 11:59 pm EST.

If you have any questions about the Mass Solar Loan program changes or your loan contract, contact us at customercare@bluewavesolar.com or (844) 786-4100.

Weâ€™re happy to help.

    <textOnly>SMART could impact your current customers.

Start preparing with BlueWave today!

What&apos;s the latest?
The MA Dept. of Energy Resources (DOER) has now released the new Base Compensation Rates for the SMART program in MA, replacing the previous SREC system. Under SMART, SRECs will no longer be available for new projects. Solar will instead receive an all-in value per kWh.

Why prepare now?
The latest policy updates indicate that that SMART may begin in June or July 2018. Depending on the timeline of your customers&apos; installations, however, their projects may fall under the SMART program based on installation start date. Customers will likely have questions now!

How should my team prepare?

BlueWave is here for you to answer any questions you may have and to help you determine how to be most effective with future program changes.
We are available to join your team in the field to help answer customers&apos; policy or loan related questions.
Feel free to reach out to our team directly with additional questions.

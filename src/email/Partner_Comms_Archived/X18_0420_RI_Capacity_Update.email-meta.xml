    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName},

RHODE ISLAND PROGRAM UPDATE

5.58 MW of cap capacity currently remains available in Rhode Island.

HERE IS WHAT BLUEWAVE IS DOING TO ADVOCATE
BlueWave attended the Northeast Clean Energy Council’s (NECEC) Clean Energy Day at the Rhode Island Statehouse on March 10 to tell policymakers that we need to increase opportunities for residential solar in the Ocean State. The Ocean State is third in energy efficiency in the nation and is fast becoming a rising star in clean energy. There’s still work to do, but the opportunities are there.

In the first six months of the 2017 Renewable Energy Growth (REG) program, residential solar completely sold out of the 6.5 MW capacity allotted. Many of our Rhode Island installers have been significantly affected by this “start-stop” inconsistency of the REG program. BlueWave is actively advocating for more consistency with program administrators and with legislators for an immediate re-allocation of an additional 2MW for the 2018 residential program.

House Bill 7050 and Senate Bill 2357 would allot unused megawatts leftover from a 2014 procurement. The good news is these bills will make it easier to allot unused megawatts in the future, making a more stable residential solar market. Additionally, NECEC is supporting an amendment that would allow for the discretion of future allocations to reside with the Distributed Generation (DG) Board, instead of as it is currently with National Grid.

Rhode Island installers can call their representatives and senators to support these bills! Let them know the solar industry is strong and Rhode Islanders want to go solar.

Want to work with BlueWave to install solar in Rhode Island?

Please contact our Business Development Manager, David Wells 617.620.6590 or BlueWave Partner Support 888.817.2703 if you are interested!

Thank you for partnering with BlueWave
to revolutionize energy.

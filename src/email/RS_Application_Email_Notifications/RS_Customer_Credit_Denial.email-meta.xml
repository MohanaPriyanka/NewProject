Dear {!Lead.FirstName},

Thank you for your recent application to participate in BlueWave&apos;s Residential Solar Loan Program. Regretfully, we are unable to approve your application at this time. The denial of your application was based upon information contained in a consumer credit report obtained from TransUnion. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that we inform you that your credit score, taken on {!Lead.Date_of_Credit_Report__c} , is {!Lead.LASER_Credit_Score__c} on a range of 501-990.

Major factors adversely affecting your credit score are the following:

{!Lead.Adverse_Credit_Notice_1__c}
{!Lead.Adverse_Credit_Notice_2__c}
{!Lead.Adverse_Credit_Notice_3__c}

Please note that you have certain rights with respect to your credit report. If you request a copy of the information in your credit file from TransUnion within 60 days of receiving this denial, you are entitled to a free copy of your report. You have the right to directly dispute with the consumer reporting agency the accuracy and completeness of any information furnished by that agency.

We welcome a new credit application from you in the future if and when your credit profile has improved. Additionally, we will reconsider your application with a qualified co-signer. If you would like to add a co-signer to your application, please fill out  this form.

Credit information was taken from TransUnion, which can be contacted at (877) 322 - 8228. TransUnion is located at 555 West Adams St., Chicago IL.

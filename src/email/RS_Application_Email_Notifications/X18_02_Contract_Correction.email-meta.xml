    <textOnly>Dear {!Opportunity.Name},

It has come to our attention that your customer contract had an error in which your interest-only period was stated as twelve months rather than eighteen.

While the first page of your contract states an eighteen month interest-only period, the second sentence of the &quot;Payment&quot; section on page 3 states, &quot;Beginning shortly after the operation date, you must make twelve monthly payments of interest only...&quot; This should say &quot;eighteen&quot;, not &quot;twelve&quot;.

We would like to grant you the full 18 month interest-only period for your loan with our lending partner Avidia Bank. If you would like to keep this 18 month interest-only period, no action is needed at this time. If you would like to convert your loan to a 12 month interest-only period, please let us know by next Friday, March 9th, 2018.

We sincerely apologize for any confusion this error in the contract may have caused. Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions you may have.

If you have any questions about your Home Solar Loan, please contact us at customercare@bluewavesolar.com or (844) 786-4100.

Kind Regards,
- BlueWave Customer Care</textOnly>

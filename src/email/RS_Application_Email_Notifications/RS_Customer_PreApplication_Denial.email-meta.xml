    <subject>Your BlueWave Solar Loan Pre-Approval Application has been denied</subject>
    <textOnly>Hi {!Lead.FirstName},

Thank you for submitting your pre-approval application to participate in BlueWave&apos;s Home Solar Loan Program.

Regretfully, we are unable to pre-approve your application at this time. You will receive an email outlining the official reasons for application denial within 30 days. If you have already received a contract for signature, you will receive notification that the contract has been voided.

You may submit a new solar loan application in the future if your credit profile improves.

We will also reconsider your application with a qualified co-signer. If you would like to add a co-signer to your application, please fill out this form.

If you do submit an application with a co-signer, you will still receive an official credit denial notice within 30 days.

You will receive separate notifications on the status of your co-application.

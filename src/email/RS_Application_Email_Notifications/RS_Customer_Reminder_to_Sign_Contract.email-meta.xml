    <textOnly>Hi {!dsfs__DocuSign_Recipient_Status__c.Name},

Your BlueWave Solar Loan contract is about to expire - don&apos;t miss out on your potential solar savings!

When a signature isn&apos;t registered within 14 days of the loan contract being sent, the contract expires. Please review the Docusign package we emailed you to prevent your contract from expiring.

Additionally, feel free to contact us at customercare@bluewavesolar.com or (844) 786 - 4100 if you&apos;d like us to resend your Docusign package, or if you have any questions.

- Thanks from all of us here at BlueWave

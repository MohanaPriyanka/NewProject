    <textOnly>Hi {!Lead.FirstName},

Thank you for submitting your pre-approval application to participate in BlueWave&apos;s Home Solar Loan Program.

Regretfully, we are unable to pre-approve your joint application at this time. You will receive an email outlining the official reasons for application denial within 30 days. If you have already received a contract for signature, you will receive notification that the contract has been voided.

You may submit a new solar loan application in the future if your credit profile improves.

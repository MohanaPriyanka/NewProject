Dear {!Lead.Co_Applicant_First_Name__c},

Thank you for your recent application to participate in BlueWave&apos;s Residential Solar Loan Program. Regretfully, we are unable to approve your application at this time. The denial of your application was based upon information contained in a consumer credit report obtained from TransUnion. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that we inform you that your credit score, taken on {!Lead.Co_App_Date_of_Credit_Report__c} , is {!Lead.Co_App_FICO__c} on a range of 501-990.

Major factors adversely affecting your credit score are the following:

{!Lead.Co_App_Credit_Report_Detail_1_c__c}
{!Lead.Co_App_Credit_Report_Detail_2__c}
{!Lead.Co_App_Credit_Report_Detail_3__c}
{!Lead.Co_App_Credit_Report_Detail_4__c}
{!Lead.Co_App_Credit_Report_Detail_5__c}

Please note that you have certain rights with respect to your credit report. If you request a copy of the information in your credit file from TransUnion within 60 days of receiving this denial, you are entitled to a free copy of your report. You have the right to directly dispute with the consumer reporting agency the accuracy and completeness of any information furnished by that agency.

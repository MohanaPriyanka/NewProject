Hi {!Contact.FirstName},

We received notice from your utility provider, (customer's utility), that your utility account (#####) has been closed.

We have cancelled your community solar subscription for that account with {!$Label.Company_Name} as we cannot send credits to a closed utility account.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Best,

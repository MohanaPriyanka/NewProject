    <subject>Welcome to BlueWave.</subject>
    <textOnly>Hey BlueWaver,  

Our energy future stars with you.

Thanks for choosing BlueWave as your Community Solar provider and supporting local solar energy. Your Community Solar agreement is now fully executed!

We&apos;re on a mission to revolutionize energy with simple, powerful solar solutions â€” and that revolution starts with you. Thank you for being here.

Please see below for more information about how BlueWave Community Solar works and helps you save on your monthly utility bill.

How do Community Solar savings work?
Your savings will come in the form of bill credits.

So, what&apos;s a bill credit? The Community Solar farm you&apos;re subscribed to will produce energy which will feed into the electric grid for distribution to you utility. Your subscription entitles you to benefit from some of that energy production through deductions on your monthly electrical utility bill. Bill credits, or &apos;credits&apos;, represent the portion of energy your Community Solar subscription has produced.

What happens after credits appear on your utility bill?
BlueWave will then send you a monthly bill for the credits that were deducted from your monthly utility bill, at a 10% discount.

For example: if your farm generates $100 worth of credits, you will see a $100 deduction on your utility bill, and then receive a BlueWave bill for $90. That 10% savings, or in this case, $10, is the benefit you get from your subscription!

What will timing look like once credits start rolling?
Once your Community Solar Farm begins generating electricity, your solar credits will begin appearing on your electricity bill each month.

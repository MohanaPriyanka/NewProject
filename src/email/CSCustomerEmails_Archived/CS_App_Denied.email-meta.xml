    <subject>Your BlueWave Community Solar Application Has Been Denied</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.FirstName},

Thank you for your recent BlueWave Community Solar application. Unfortunately, we are unable to approve your application at this time based on the consumer credit report pulled by Transunion.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires that we inform you that your credit score, taken on {!Lead.Date_of_Credit_Report__c} , is {!Lead.LASER_Credit_Score__c} on a range of 501-990.

Major factors adversely affecting your credit score are the following:

{!Lead.Credit_Report_Detail_1__c}
{!Lead.Credit_Report_Detail_2__c}
{!Lead.Credit_Report_Detail_3__c}
{!Lead.Credit_Report_Detail_4__c}

Please note that you have certain rights with respect to your credit report. If you request a copy of the information in your credit file from TransUnion within 60 days of receiving this denial, you are entitled to a free copy of your report. You have the right to directly dispute with the consumer reporting agency the accuracy and completeness of any information furnished by that agency.

Credit information was taken from TransUnion, which can be contacted at (877)-322-8228. TransUnion is located at 555 West Adams St., Chicago IL.

We would be happy to revisit your application once Transunion&apos;s criteria has been met.

Thanks for considering BlueWave, we hope to be able to serve you in the future.

- All of us here at BlueWave

    <subject>We&apos;re Unable to Move Forward with {!Lead.Name}&apos;s Application</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Lead.Partner_Name__c},

{!Lead.Name}&apos;s rate class isn&apos;t supported by the New York&apos;s community solar program at this time, meaning we are unable to proceed with their application.

Rate class eligibility is determined by the state and utility providers, so unfortunately this one&apos;s out of our hands.

However if {!Lead.Name} has another utility account, we&apos;d be happy to take another look at their eligibility. Please respond here or call our Partner Support team at 888.997.2432 to discuss their eligibility.

- Thanks from all of us here at BlueWave

    <subject>Your Community Solar Garden Subscription is Now Live!</subject>
    <textOnly>Welcome To The %%Project%% Community Solar Garden!

Credits are now flowing from the %%Project%% Community Solar Garden to your utility bill, which means your savings have begun!

How do these savings work?
Your savings will come in the form of Solar* Rewards Community Solar Production Credits.

Your community solar garden produces energy which feeds into the electric grid for distribution to your utility provider, Xcel Energy. Your subscription entitles you to benefit from some of that energy production through production credits on your monthly Xcel bill. Production credits, or more simply &apos;credits,&apos; represent the portion of energy your community solar subscription has produced.

Where can you find credits on your Xcel and Amp powered by BlueWave bills?
Your credits will appear in two places on your Xcel bill. They will first appear in the Summary of Current Charges section as ‘Other Recurring Charges’:


They will also appear in your Other Recurring Charges Details section:

Depending on your billing cycle, you should expect to receive your first Amp powered by BlueWave bill roughly two months after the credits have been initially accrued. Below is an example of what your Amp powered by BlueWave bill will look like:

What happens after credits appear on your utility bill?
BlueWave will then send you a monthly bill for the credits that were deducted from your monthly utility bill, at a discount.

For example: if your solar garden generates $100 worth of credits, you will see a $100 deduction on your utility bill, and then receive a BlueWave bill for $85. That 15% savings, or in this case, $15, is the benefit you get from your subscription!

Depending on your billing cycle, you should expect to receive your first Amp powered by BlueWave bill roughly two months after the credits have been initially accrued. Below is an example of what your Amp powered by BlueWave bill will look like:

What will the timing look like?
It takes about two months after your solar garden generates energy for your credits to appear on your utility bill and Amp powered by BlueWave bill.

To get a better idea of how that timing often works, please see the example below:

How can I access my Amp powered by BlueWave Portal?

    <textOnly>Dear {!Opportunity.Name},

Thank you for your recent BlueWave Community Solar application. Unfortunately, we cannot approve your application because we do not support your utility rate class at this time. We are working with policymakers to expand community solar access to everyone, and hope that we can support your rate class in the future. Donâ€™t hesitate to contact us if you have any questions.

Thanks for considering BlueWave,

- All of us here at BlueWave

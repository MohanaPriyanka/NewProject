If any payment date falls on a weekend or holiday, I understand and agree that the payment may be executed on the next business day. If necessary, I also authorize BlueWave or its servicer(s), or an assignee or its servicer(s), to initiate one-time credit or debit transactions to correct any erroneous payment transaction. I also authorize BlueWave or its servicer(s), or an assignee or its servicer(s), to (a) initiate a one-time transaction to collect a fee of $0 if any payment is rejected by the bank for any reason (such as insufficient funds), (b) to collect any late fee due under the community solar agreement, or (c) to collect any early termination fee due under the community solar agreement. I understand that any debit entry from the account that is returned unpaid may be collected in the same manner as an unpaid paper check. I understand that the monthly payment amount debited from the bank account or charged to the credit card or debit card account may vary from month to month based on variable generation from the solar project. This authorization will remain in effect until all amounts I owe to BlueWave or an assignee in connection with the community solar agreement have been paid in full or this authorization is cancelled in writing by providing notice of cancellation to BCS Customer Management, LLC, at 111 Huntington Avenue, Suite 650, Boston, MA 02199, or to its designee. I understand and agree that BlueWave must receive written notice of any changes in the account information or termination of this authorization at least three (3) business days prior to the next billing date. I certify that I am the account holder or an authorized signer of the deposit account or the cardholder or an authorized user of the credit card or debt card account identified above, and that I will not dispute any payment initiated by BlueWave or its servicer(s), or an assignee or its servicer(s), provided that the transaction corresponds to the terms of this authorization. If I am signing on behalf of the account holder, I certify that I am authorized to do so, and that the account holder will not dispute any payment initiated by BlueWave or its servicer(s), or an assignee or its servicer(s), provided that the transaction corresponds to the terms of this authorization. If I am authorizing payments from a deposit account, I agree and certify that the account holder agrees to comply with and be bound by the Rules and Operating Guidelines of NACHA (formerly known as the National Automated Clearing House Association). I understand that I should print a copy of this completed authorization for my records.</textarea>

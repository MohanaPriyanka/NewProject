                    This marketing material is provided by {label.companyNameCustomerAcquisition} and {label.companyNameCustomerManagement}, both entities in the
                    {label.companyName} family of companies. The solar farm depicted is not owned by a {label.companyName} company and is not necessarily the farm you would be joining. It is depicted for representative purposes only.
                    *Environmental benefits of this project are based on the average annual output of the project and calculated using the EPA Greenhouse Gas Equivalencies Calculator (2018) epa.gov/energy. Neither
                    {label.companyName} nor you will receive renewable energy or environmental attributes from {label.companyName}â€™s community solar subscription.
                    **The output equivalent number is based on the estimated average annual kWh output value for the project and average annual U.S. home energy consumption as determined by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (Annual Energy Outlook 2018, https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/aeo/).
